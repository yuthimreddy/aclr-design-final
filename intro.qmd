# Introduction

After athletes tear their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL),many undergo ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery. However, physicians and other
researchers are still evaluating the recovery and health of patients who have undergone ACLR. It is important to note that a majority of 
patients do not get reinjured - in this study, 83% had no reinjuries after ACLR surgery. There are many features that can affect reinjury 
rates after the surgery, such as the gender of the patient, the graft type used, and even their mental readiness. Our stakeholders are 
interested in all of these factors and what specific combination will lead to the lowest reinjury rates in patients after ACLR surgery is performed.
